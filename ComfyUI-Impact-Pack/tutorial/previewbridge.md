# PreviewBridge: Nodes for supporting 'Clipspace' utilization

* The ```PreviewBridge``` node is a node designed to utilize the Clipspace feature. By right-clicking on the node, you can access a context menu where you can choose the ```Copy (Clipspace)``` option to copy to **Clipspace**. You can then edit the copied data using the **MaskEditor** in **Clipspace** and use ```Paste (Clipspace)``` to apply the changes back to the node.

* Another way to achieve immediate reflection of changes in PreviewBridge is to edit and save changes directly in the MaskEditor using the ```Open in MaskEditor``` option, and then save the changes to the node using the ```Save to node``` button.
