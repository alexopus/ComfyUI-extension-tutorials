## PreviewBridge
* The PreviewBridge node is a node designed to utilize the Clipspace feature. By right-clicking on the node, you can access a context menu where you can choose the "Copy (Clipspace)" option to copy to Clipspace. You can then edit the copied data using the MaskEditor in Clipspace and use "Paste (Clipspace)" to apply the changes back to the node.

* [In a future update of ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/pull/649), it will be possible to edit and save changes directly in the MaskEditor by using the "Open in MaskEditor" option. This will allow for immediate reflection of changes in PreviewBridge.
